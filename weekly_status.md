# Weekly Status Reports

Each week, please spend 5-10 minutes writing a brief status report.  This does not need to be highly detailed. Some examples are provided below that give some indication of the level of detail.

*Copy the template below for each subsequent week.  Please put the most recent week at the **TOP** of the page.*


## Week 2

Report for the week of 3/27/17 to 4/03/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

 This week, We worked on scraping and cleaning the data and wrote code in lab6.py to convert to our data files to csv. We also worked on writing SQL commands to load some of the datasets that we gathered into a database. We did most of the work together that it is difficult to specify which work was whose specifically. Abeneazer contributed more to the work that loaded the data into the database.

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *[Abeneazer Chafamo]: 33%*
- *[Carlton Yang]: 33%*
- *[Degena Woldemariam]: 33%

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Our main goal for next week is writing the SQL commands to write 10 exploratory queries.  We will use lab3 as a template.*


## Week 3

What did each project team member do this week?

Abeneazer worked on scraping the NBA API to get the data for shot logs.
Degena worked on getting the shot logs data into a pandas dataframe
Carlton was out of town this week on his grad school tour.

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:
- *[Abeneazer Chafamo]: 50%*
- *[Carlton Yang]: 0%*
- *[Degena Woldemariam]: 50%


## Week 4

This week we worked on figuring out the attributes we need to work on our shot predictor. The shot predictor
will have upto six attributes. The attributes are players offensive rating, field goal percentage from previous years,
the closest defenders distance, the defenders defensive rating, the shot distance or type, and time on the shot clock.

The issue we faced with this was that we have shot logs for the year 2014-15 but most of the other data such as defensive rating,
and shooting percentage would come from the 2011-2012 season which is pretty far off.

Degena and Carlton are working on figuring out on mathcing the data. And Abeneazer on writng the algorithm to train the data.

Division of labor:

- *[Abeneazer Chafamo]: 40%*
- *[Carlton Yang]: 30%*
- *[Degena Woldemariam]: 30%
