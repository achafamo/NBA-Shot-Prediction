# COSC 480 DS Project

The project guidelines can be found on the [course website](https://github.com/colgate-cosc480ds/lecture).

Please describe any VM setup required for your project here.

This could include commands to download data from online sources.  (Ideally, you should *not* commit raw data to your repo but instead provide instructions on how to obtain it.)

## Getting the data

You need to install/make sure you included pydotplus and tree.export_graphviz to reproduce the decision tree graph.

The data we used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle and since we could not add a link to download the file we have pushed it to the repo. It is only 16mb therefore we dont believe that it will be an issue.
